# VS_SysEx_Generator
Little Commandline SysEx generation utility for [VS_Faderbox](https://github.com/nativeVS/VS_Faderbox).  
I apologise for this being utterly low quality, however it does the job well for me, so unless there is someone willing to build a nice UI based application or I find myself sufficiently bored to start looking at wxWidgets this will be it.
  

Windows (x64) version can be found [here](https://github.com/nativeVS/VS_SysEx_Generator/raw/main/VS_SysEx_Generator_CommandLine/x64/Release/VS_SysEx_Generator_CommandLine.exe).  
Mac version can be found [here](https://github.com/nativeVS/VS_SysEx_Generator/raw/main/VS_SysEx_Generator_CommandLine/x64/Release/VS_SysEx_Generator_CommandLine).
  
Main directory is currently just a straight dump from the VisualStudio Project directory. Should compile fine cross-platform with C++17.
  
Mac version was just quickly created by copying into XCode and dumping a quick build into the Release folder.
